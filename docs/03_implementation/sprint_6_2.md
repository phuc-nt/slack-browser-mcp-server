# Sprint 6.2: Time-Range Thread Collection Tool

## üìã Sprint Overview

**Objective**: Implement a specialized tool for collecting complete thread conversations that had activity within a specific time range.

**Duration**: Aug 12-13, 2025 (2 days)

**Priority**: HIGH - Essential for comprehensive conversation analysis and thread discovery based on temporal activity

---

## üéØ Sprint Goals

### Primary Goal
Implement `collect_threads_by_timerange` tool that performs a 3-step process to collect all complete thread conversations that had message activity within a specified time period.

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Tool successfully implements 3-step collection process
- ‚úÖ Handles pagination for large datasets 
- ‚úÖ Returns complete thread data (parent + all replies)
- ‚úÖ Provides clear metadata about collection scope
- ‚úÖ 100% test success rate with real workspace data

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Tool Specification

**Tool Name**: `collect_threads_by_timerange`

**Category**: Data Collection

**Use Case**: 
- Comprehensive thread analysis for specific time periods
- Research conversations that were active during incidents/events
- Collect discussion threads for meeting preparation or retrospectives
- Thread activity analysis for specific date ranges

**API Endpoints Used**:
1. `conversations.history` - Find messages in time range
2. `conversations.replies` - Get complete thread data

### 3-Step Process Implementation

```javascript
// STEP 1: conversations.history to find messages in time range
const historyParams = {
  channel: channelId,
  oldest: startTimestamp,  // Unix timestamp with microseconds
  latest: endTimestamp,    // Unix timestamp with microseconds  
  inclusive: true,
  limit: 999
}

// STEP 2: Identify thread activity from messages
const threadTimestamps = new Set();
messages.forEach(msg => {
  if (msg.reply_count > 0) threadTimestamps.add(msg.ts);
  if (msg.thread_ts && msg.thread_ts !== msg.ts) threadTimestamps.add(msg.thread_ts);
});

// STEP 3: conversations.replies for each identified thread
for (const threadTs of threadTimestamps) {
  const repliesParams = {
    channel: channelId,
    ts: threadTs,
    inclusive: true,
    limit: 999
  }
}
```

## üìù Tool Definition

### Input Schema

```typescript
{
  channel: string;           // Channel ID (required)
  start_date: string;        // ISO date or Unix timestamp
  end_date: string;          // ISO date or Unix timestamp  
  include_parent?: boolean;  // Include parent message (default: true)
  include_metadata?: boolean; // Include thread metadata (default: true)
  max_threads?: number;      // Limit number of threads (default: 50)
}
```

### Response Structure

```typescript
{
  channel: string;
  time_range: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
    duration_hours: number;
  },
  collection_summary: {
    total_threads_found: number;
    threads_returned: number;
    total_messages_collected: number;
    collection_method: "3-step-process"
  },
  threads: [
    {
      thread_ts: string;
      parent_message: MessageObject;
      replies: MessageObject[];
      thread_stats: {
        reply_count: number;
        participant_count: number;
        first_reply_ts: string;
        last_reply_ts: string;
      }
    }
  ],
  metadata: {
    api_calls_made: number;
    execution_time_ms: number;
    pagination_info: object;
  }
}
```

### Tool Description (AI-Optimized)

```markdown
Collect complete thread conversations that had message activity within a specific time range. 

This tool uses a specialized 3-step process:
1. Find all messages in the time range using conversations.history
2. Identify threads that had activity (new messages or replies) 
3. Fetch complete thread data including all replies using conversations.replies

PERFECT FOR:
- Research conversations during specific incidents or events
- Collect discussion threads for meeting preparation  
- Analyze thread activity patterns for specific date ranges
- Comprehensive conversation analysis for retrospectives

EXAMPLE QUERIES:
- "Get all threads with activity last week in #general"
- "Find discussion threads during the deployment on Aug 10"
- "Collect active conversations from yesterday's meeting"

Returns complete thread data with parent messages and all replies, even if the thread was started outside the time range but had replies within it.
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Cases

1. **Basic Time Range Collection**
   - Collect threads from last 24 hours
   - Verify complete thread data returned
   - Validate 3-step process execution

2. **Edge Case Testing**  
   - Time range with no thread activity
   - Threads started before range but active during
   - Large result sets requiring pagination
   - Invalid date formats and error handling

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure execution time for different result sets
   - API rate limiting compliance  
   - Memory usage for large thread collections

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify all replies are collected
   - Check thread metadata accuracy
   - Validate timestamp filtering logic
